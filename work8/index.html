      <p class="firstletter">This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve o'clock
         a troop of ten or
         twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the
         way with its cowâ€“catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil
         gait, uttering now and then deafening
         bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can
         moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.</p>
      <p>The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of
         all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to
         get out of the way.
         Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon
         them.</p>
      <p>What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were not
         impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here's an
         engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"</p>

         The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise.

            <p class="parag">I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of
               Orion. I watched
               C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time... like
               tears in rain... <span class="ital">Time to die.</span></p>
